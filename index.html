                <h2>The Data Bottleneck</h2>
                <p>In 2025, every decision is a data decision. Yet, a critical gap exists between business teams who need answers and the technical experts who hold the keys to the data.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Business Teams</strong> wait up to <strong>4-5 days</strong> for simple reports, hindering agility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Analysts</strong> spend over <strong>60%</strong> of their time on repetitive, ad-hoc requests.</li>
                </ul>
